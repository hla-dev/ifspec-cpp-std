# IEEE 1516-2010 Interface Specification C++ API

This is a "clone" of the standard IEEE 1516-2010.1 C++ API source files. These
source files can be downloaded from
[the IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1516_1-2010.html). The source
files contain the following licence:

> The IEEE hereby grants a general, royalty-free license to copy, distribute,
> display and make derivative works from this material, for all purposes,

> additional information, contact the Manager, Standards Intellectual Property,
> IEEE Standards Association (stds-ipr@ieee.org).

Note that this C++ API is just header files. They are sufficient to develop
against, but an RTI that provides an implementation of these headers is require
to test actual functionality.
